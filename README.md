# Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

This repository is for the creation of a decompilation hack of Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire.
Due to the unique nature of both the original Ruby and Sapphire and their development,
this repository will actually build two separate rom hacks: Ruby Plus and Sapphire Plus.

Both hacks are identical with regards to their changes to their respective base games.
Regarding these changes, this hack is inspired by the "Pokemon Legacy" hack series led by
SmithPlaysPokemon. Similar to a "Legacy" game, Ruby Plus and Sapphire Plus will feature
the following changes:

- All Pokemon obtainable in a single game
- Modifying game balance by shifting stats and moves
- Dark is made physical and Ghost is made special
- Some changes to Pokemon locations to improve availability
- Changes to trainer teams to improve Pokemon representation and slightly increase difficulty

The original readme from pret's pokeruby project is below:
